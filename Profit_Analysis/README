Profit Analysis Portfolio Project

Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of profit performance for a superstore. 
The goal is to uncover key trends and drivers of profit and loss across various dimensions such as regions, 
customer segments, and product categories. The analysis also includes predictive modeling to forecast 
profit gains and identify areas for improvement.

Data

The primary dataset comes from the file super_store_order.xlsx and includes information such as:
Order Details: Order dates, shipping mode, discounts, unit prices, and quantities.
Financial Metrics: Sales and profit figures.
Customer Information: Customer segments and geographic details (region, state, city).
Product Information: Product categories and sub-categories.

Analysis Components

Descriptive Analysis:

Calculation of maximum, minimum, and total profit across regions and customer segments.
Trend analysis using monthly profit data.
Visualisations such as bar charts and tree maps to display profit distribution.

Diagnostic Analysis:

Investigation of factors (e.g., discounts, shipping costs) affecting profit performance.
Examination of profit loss in specific product categories and customer segments.
Use of statistical models and correlation analysis to determine key drivers.

Predictive Modeling:

Development of classification models to predict profit gain versus loss.
Evaluation of model performance using confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC-AUC curves.
Model tuning and hyper-parameter adjustment for improved performance.

Tools and Libraries

The project is built using Python and Jupyter Notebook, leveraging several key libraries:

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For generating visualisations.
Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
Statsmodels: For conducting statistical analyses.

How to Run

Open the Notebook:
Launch the Profit Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the Analysis:
Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the full analysis.

Conclusion

This portfolio project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to profit analysis by combining 
descriptive and diagnostic analytics with predictive modelling. The insights drawn from the 
data provide actionable recommendations for improving business performance across various dimensions. 
Feedback and suggestions for further improvements are welcome.
