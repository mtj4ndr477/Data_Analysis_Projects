# Credit Card Data Cleaning

## Overview
This notebook documents the project teamâ€™s process for cleaning and preparing the credit card dataset. The cleaning ensures the dataset is consistent, reliable, and ready for further analysis.

## Key Steps
- Checked for missing values and imputed them using skewness analysis to decide between mean vs. median.
- Imputed `CREDIT_LIMIT` and `MINIMUM_PAYMENTS` with the **median** due to strong right-skewness.
- Verified and confirmed no duplicate records.

## Outcomes
The dataset was cleaned, imputed, and validated for duplicates, making it ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.
