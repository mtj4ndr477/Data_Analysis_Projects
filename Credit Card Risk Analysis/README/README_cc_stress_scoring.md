# Credit Card Stress Scoring

## Overview
This notebook describes the project teamâ€™s methodology for creating a **Stress Score** to quantify risky customer behaviors. The scoring system helps identify customers who may require proactive intervention.

## Key Steps
- Defined behavioral risk flags: high cash advances, low payments, high utilization, large minimum payments, irregular balances.
- Calculated a composite **Stress Score** by summing risk flags.
- Translated scores into business-friendly risk levels: Low, Medium, High.
- Created an **Attention Flag** as a binary target variable for forecasting.

## Outcomes
The Stress Scoring Model provides an interpretable framework to assess risk, prioritize customers needing attention, and enable predictive modeling.
